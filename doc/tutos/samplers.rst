Recipe for a good sampling strategy for SkWDRO
==============================================

.. tip:: Read the `tutorial on SkWDRO <../why_skwdro.html>`__ to understand better this part.


Recall the formula for SkWDRO:

.. math::
    :label: dual_loss

    L_\theta^\texttt{robust}(\xi) := \lambda\rho + \varepsilon\log\mathbb{E}_{\zeta\sim\nu_\xi}\left[e^{\frac{L_\theta(\zeta)-\lambda c(\xi, \zeta)}{\varepsilon}}\right].

Its inner expectation :math:`\nu_\xi` is cruxial to the estimation, as it sheds light on the *a priori* knowledge you will incorporate into the estimation of the true risk measure.
We will answer the question of **how to pick this crucial hyperparameter**.

Use pre-built options
=====================

The library relies on various pre-built combinations of distributions, covering modelisation with and without targets (more details on the `wdro presentation <../wdro.html>`_).

Problem-specific examples
-------------------------

Some samplers for specific robust models have been implemented to provide guidelines for inspiration of astute readers of their source code, as well as ready out-of-the-box options.

Almost all of the pre-implemented samplers rely on a normal distribution for the input data, with varying distributions for the targets (which, recall, are called `labels` in the code's nomenclature in order to catter to machine learning applications).
- For a Bernoulli law on targets :math:`\{-1, 1\}`, see :py:class:`skwdro.base.samplers.torch.ClassificationNormalBernouilliSampler`.
- To sample a dirac distribution on :math:`\xi_\texttt{labels}`, see :py:class:`skwdro.base.samplers.torch.ClassificationNormalIdSampler`.
- If the target's space has less structure, use a normal distribution (e.g. for regression tasks, even though the name suggests otherwise), see :py:class:`skwdro.base.samplers.torch.ClassificationNormalNormalSampler`.
- If you have problems that do not have targets, you can draw inspiration from either :py:class:`skwdro.base.samplers.torch.PortfolioNormalSampler` or :py:class:`skwdro.base.samplers.torch.NewsVendorNormalSampler`. For an example without a normal distribution on the inputs, see :py:class:`skwdro.base.samplers.torch.PortfolioLaplaceSampler`.

Cost-based sampling
-------------------

If your cost functional has been crafted with care, it might include a default sampling option defined as singleton of pair o:py:class:torch.distributions.Distribution`\ (s).
In this case, defining a sampler is more natural and can be done from the cost's methods through two helper classes.

.. autoclass:: skwdro.base.samplers.torch.LabeledCostSampler
   :members:
   :inherited-members:
   :no-index:

.. autoclass:: skwdro.base.samplers.torch.NoLabelsCostSampler
   :members:
   :inherited-members:
   :no-index:




Build your own sampler
======================

The library exposes three main interfaces to make your own sampling strategy.
What they will implement is a conditional measure of probability :math:`\nu_\xi` that, given a reference :math:`\xi` value (or batch thereof), will sample a batch of :math:`\zeta` realisations.

Some background to make educated guesses
----------------------------------------

This measure stems theoretically from the `entropic regularization <../why_skwdro.html>`__ of the WDRO problem: the addition of the term :math:`\mathcal{D}_\text{KL}(\pi, \pi_0)` in the objective function of the primal problem will, after some lagrangian duality induced manipulations (see [#AIM23]_), produce the logsumexp structure of :eq:`dual_loss`.
In this procedure, a disintegration lemma must be used to split the reference generator :math:`\pi_0(\xi, \zeta)` into two parts. Under heavy abuse of notation, it would write as follows.

.. math::

   P_{\pi_0}(\xi\in X\cap\zeta\in Y) = \underbrace{P_{\pi_0}(\xi\in X)}_{\hat{\mathbb{P}}^N(X)}\underbrace{P_{\pi_0}(\zeta\in Y|\xi\in X)}_{\nu_\xi(Y)}.

.. note:: A common wisdom is that ususally, if :math:`\nu_\xi` does depend on :math:`\xi`, it should better average to it i.e.

   .. math::

      \mathbb{E}_{\zeta\sim\nu_\xi}[\zeta|\xi]\approx\xi.

   This property is by no means necessary, but proves useful in verifying one of the assumptions from [#AIM23]_ which is strict feasability of the reference distribution (i.e :math:`\mathbb{E}_{(\xi, \zeta)\sim\pi_0}[c]<\rho`).
   Otherwise, choosing carfully :math:`\nu_\xi` such that it is independant of :math:`\xi` may be relevant for some applications.

In general, one must consider well-posed problems in which :math:`\nu_\xi` has good properties: it is not too far from :math:`\hat{\mathbb{P}}^N` but it also explores far enough of it to provide robustification, i.e. gets closer to the true problem's distribution :math:`\mathbb{P}`.

The common interface for samplers
---------------------------------

To build your own sampler, you can write a class that inherits :py:class:`skwdro.base.sampler.torch.BaseSampler`, or to be more precise inherit one of the following classes:

.. autoclass:: skwdro.base.samplers.torch.LabeledSampler
   :members:
   :inherited-members:
   :no-index:

.. autoclass:: skwdro.base.samplers.torch.NoLabelsSampler
   :members:
   :inherited-members:
   :no-index:

These two templates leave for you to define **only two methods**: the constructor and a special :py:meth:`skwdro.base.samplers.torch.BaseSampler.reset_sampler` method that defines how to change the parameters of :math:`\nu_\xi` if :math:`\xi` changes (resetting dynamically the :py:class:`torch.distributions.Distribution` objects if needs be.
But while it is not mendatory, one may rewrite to their liking some custom methods, including the central :py:meth:`skwdro.base.samplers.torch.BaseSampler.sample` method used by the library.

Learning by examples
--------------------

Say now you want to implement a logistic regression model based on a mixture of continuous and discrete features as described in [#BSW23]_.
As mentionned in the paper, contrary to continuous-features WDRO logistic regression, the robust loss function cannot be cast as a regularized version of the empirical risk minimization.
Hence the robustness is harder to achieve, and while the authors propose, between other tools, a cutting-plane algorithm to solve WDRO, we could attempt to robustify mixed-features logistic regression with `SkWDRO`.

Let's consider that the problem is formulated such that the `n_continuous_features`\ +\ `n_discrete_features` features are concatenated in an input variable `xi`, and target labels are in `xi_labels`. Consider the discrete features to be first one-hot encoded and then recentered to :math:`\{-1, 1\}`, just like in the usual logistic regression from the documentation. Here is how we would build the sampler for such a problem in pytorch.

       discrete_features_s: dst.TransformedDistribution
       """
       This class samples both continuous and discrete features of the design space.
       The inputs ``xi`` are assumed to follow a layout in which the continuous
       features are arranged at the beginning of the features vector and the
       discrete ones follow, with the labels treated separately as the
       ``xi_labels`` variable.
       The concatenation in ``xi`` of the features must be done on the last axis,
       the categorical variables are encoded in {-1, +1} with -1 representing the negation
       of the class at a given index while +1 represents a realisation of the class.
       Any value between -1 and 1 may also be used to represent an unsure class. To allow
       this, all the tensor must be encoded as one common floating type (e.g. float32).

The method that we should add to this class is the sampling procedure.
It is composed of the sampling of the continuous input variable, its categorical part, and the perturbation of the labels.

Finally, we tackle the mendatory part linked to the reset of the sampler's moments ``xi`` and ``xi_labels``.
